Nightsky is a color theme inspired by the mysterious colors and the chilling darkness of our universe.

The theme is based on the [Base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) model although some liberties were taken
with respect to the asssignment of base indices to code features.

## Example

## Implementations
At the moment the theme is implemented for the Eclipse Color Theme plugin exclusively, though other implementations may follow.

## License
The Nightsky theme is licensed under permissive MIT, so anyone can use, edit, implement it however they like!
Should you implement this theme in another language/editor, please let me know so I can include it in the list.
